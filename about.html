	<p>Originally, SHADES was formerly known as the Black Student Union (BSU). The Black Student Union was founded and ran by Laura Sanchez, an ambitious young woman who took St. Mark's' need for affinity into her own hands. As BSU's leader, she offered students of color a place to come together and celebrate their blackness at an institution where it seemed like celebrating blackness was not too welcome. </p>

	<p>As the years passed, BSU developed into a space where students of color could come together to feel safe. The BSU also began getting involved in the local community through service work. The evolution of the BSU lead to the transition into becoming SHADES.</p>
